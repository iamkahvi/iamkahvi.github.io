I don't know how it happened, but I've developed a hatred of my ENGR 12 professor. 

She is perfect example of everything I want to avoid in University.

It seems like I have been reading so much about behavioural economics exactly to be confronted with someone who is so entirely ignorant of anything to do with the subject.
Almost all her claims are built on such fragile assumptions that could be proven wrong so quickly.

This course could genuinely be taught my a Youtube playlist and a dropbox account. 

I would enjoy it so much more.

You have no idea how much I would appreciate someone who actually knew how to use Microsoft Office. 

THAT WOULD BE SO USEFUL.

Yet we are stuck with this technically illiterate moron who is too confident in her ability to teach us anything.
