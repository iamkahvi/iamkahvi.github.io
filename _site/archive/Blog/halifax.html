        <p><i>August 2017</i><br><br></p>
            <p>I’ve tried to start this a few times.</p>
            <p>I'm going to Victoria in the fall.</p>
            <p>Please forgive the forthcoming John-Green-teenage-romance-movie language.</p>
<p>I don’t know how else to say this: You are my closest group of friends.</p>
<p>I feel really shitty acknowledging this goodbye. Everything was so blurry for the past month. This summer felt like a break and not an ending.</p>

<p>I can’t pretend like I’m certain about the decision I’m making. There’s so much uncertainty in my life right now and nothing really seems absolute about my future. I just know that the program in Victoria is better for me, and I feel like I'll do well there.
<p>For me, this past year was the most defining period of my life and I am so thankful to you for that. </p>
<p>I never want to forget the times we’ve had.</p>
<p>This past year was so much more about people than it was about school, and I’m only realizing that now.</p>
<p>I miss you guys and I will continue to miss you.</p>
<p>I know that you all will get somewhere great in life.</p>
<p>You all deserve so much. You are all so kind. Please realize that you can help sarcastic, boring pricks like me and open them up to things beyond what they can learn on their own.</p>
<p>You guys changed me and I owe you everything for that.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Sidenote: Also I'm getting a tattoo and I need your input. It's to remember Halifax. I'm thinking like just the letters "UKC" in like handwriting or like the geographical coordinates of Alex Hall or maybe like an anchor?? idk but plz text me before I make a bad decision</p>
