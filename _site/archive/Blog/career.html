        <p><i>December 2016</i><br><br></p>
        
            <p>The line between hobby, occupation and passion is becoming very important for me. Yet the more I think on it, the less it gets defined. I think of myself as a pragmatic person. So when someone asks &ldquo;What would you do if money were no object?&rdquo; it seems like a forgone idea. I put almost no amount of thought into answering that question before denying the premise of it.</p>
    
            <p>When I think back, the one turning point in my outlook on the future came in the focus program. There were multiple outside factors including application deadlines and my fellow student&rsquo;s choices of either medicine, commerce
                or engineering, but, for me, reality set in when we were asked to sort ourselves into our desired professions. I ended up with the nerdy, timid graphic designers, while the smarter, louder group of desiring architects sat across the room.
                In that moment, the reality of the career choice I was making set in. I mean, I had thought of the struggle of being a graphic designer and the twisted path it would bring to my life but this pushed
                me over the edge.</p>
            <p>I realize this seems dramatic. And the associations I am making with an entire profession based on this sample size are ridiculous. But, even reflecting back on this moment, I don&rsquo;t think I could&rsquo;ve changed my mind.</p>
            <p>So I grasped on the whatever was closest. That turned out to be architecture. Why did is do this? Personally, I explain it to myself as a"need to be challenged". Although, my logic surrounding that is definitely sketchy. I don&rsquo;t want to be left behind or looked down on or be thought less of.</p>
            <p>More seriously though, my other concern is that my fire will burn out. That I&rsquo;ll become lazy or unmotivated. That everything will become less important and blas&eacute; to me. When that moment comes, where will I be? Working a well paying
                engineering job? or struggling as a graphic designer where the only thing keeping food in the table is my passion. In my view that risk is large, compounded by the fact that I have a very comfortable safety net of two wealthy doctors that
                wouldn&rsquo;t let me starve.</p>
            <p>It all comes down to perspective. Whether I consciously realize it or not, I am constantly comparing myself to my KCVI peers. The ones that I know. And every single one is either in medicine, commerce or engineering. I compare myself to them
                and realize that theirs is a more pragmatic, safe approach to a career. I read about unemployment and undergrads waiting table. I read about people not having enough money to retire. I read about graphic designers doing multiple hours
                of work for next to nothing. Is following my &ldquo;passion&rdquo; really worth that risk? So far, I would say no.</p>
