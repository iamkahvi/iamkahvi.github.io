        <p><strong><em>this post is incomplete</em></strong></p>

<p>Two questions that I don’t know the answer to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Why do we keep theorizing about why the 2016 election turned out the way it did?</li>
  <li>Why am I so much more involved in the US political system than my own?</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="1-2016-election">1. 2016 Election</h1>

<p>Never has something been so publicized. This orange buffoon was somehow always on a TV. Obviously I never thought he would be elected. In fact, I would’ve bet a lot of money on him losing the primary.</p>

<p>Anyway, then he won all of it.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after there came the speculation. It usually starts with a well-intentioned discussion of politics that devolves into people trying to justify why he won:</p>

<p>Was it</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sexism?</li>
  <li>Racism?</li>
  <li>The establishment?</li>
  <li>Two party system?</li>
  <li>Populism?</li>
  <li>Angry middle class?</li>
  <li>Political incorrectness?</li>
  <li>Television presence?</li>
  <li>Media attention?</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it was the media.</p>

<p>But the point is WHO CARES? Until we figure out how to make a truth serum and chem trail it into the lungs of every American citizen, there is not concrete way to know.</p>

<p>Main point:</p>

<h3 id="we-will-never-know-why-trump-won-the-2016-election"><strong>We will never know why Trump won the 2016 election.</strong></h3>

<p>Why keep talking?</p>

<h1 id="2">2.</h1>

<p>I pay more attention to US politics than I do Canadian politics.</p>

<p>Naming the speaker of the house, senate majority and minority leader, secretary of state, defence, energy, education and the vice-president is easy, yet naming anyone other than Justin Trudeau in the Canadian executive branch is impossible. Is it even called an executive branch here? I don’t know.</p>

<p>Justifying my seemingly extreme interest in US politics is difficult. Am I engaged because these policies and changes in leadership could affect my own life? No. Although they may have a vague effect on me, it is unreasonable to think that anything other than a declaration of war by the US would be directly relevant to me. 
That is not to say that US politics are not relevant to me <em>at all</em>, the point is that there are <em>many</em> more relevant things I could be paying attention to.</p>

<p>The real reason why I pay an unreasonable amount of attention to US politics is:</p>

<p><b>It’s entertainment that makes you feel smart.</b></p>

<p>This is why:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Almost all of what I pay attention to will not affect me.</li>
  <li>I rarely learn more than the headline, and almost never delve into the actually policy at hand.</li>
  <li>More often than not, I do not learn anything from the news.</li>
</ol>

<p>What I learn on a week to week basis is basically the equivalent of a Stephen Colbert monologue. I remember the headlines, forget the policy and get some entertainment out of the process.</p>

<p>Question: Why don’t I follow Canadian politics just as attentively?</p>

<p>Answer: The US has a sophisticated media infrastructure built around making politics entertaining.</p>

<p>Before it was the president’s <em>intent</em> to be entertaining, the media made politics entertaining on its own. Remember Obama’s Khaki suit? Or the birth certificate?</p>

<p>Why doesn’t Canada have the same entertainment infrastructure? Where is our Stephen Colbert monologue making fun of Justin Trudeau’s socks or something?</p>

<p>Reasons why there isn’t entertainment focused around Canadian politics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The events happening aren’t as exciting?</li>
  <li>People in Canada are not interested in politics</li>
  <li>There are less people in general, less potential viewers</li>
</ul>

<p>Sidenote: The first reason might cause the following one.</p>

<p>A misconception is that an audience for Canadian politics doesn’t exist. If the way the news is presented is entertaining, an audience will develop.</p>

<p>Example #1: me. Why am I consuming so much US political news? Because of the way it is presented. There is almost no logical reason why I should be as engaged as I am in the Virginia Governor’s Race, but I’m refreshing the polls right now all the same.</p>

<p>Forms of media about politics that I consume:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pod Save America</li>
      <li>The Ezra Klein Show</li>
      <li>This American Life</li>
      <li>Revisionist History</li>
      <li>On The Media</li>
      <li>Stay Tuned</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="youtube">Youtube</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Phillip Defranco</li>
      <li>John Oliver</li>
      <li>Stephen Colbert</li>
      <li>Samantha Bee</li>
      <li>Seth Myers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="news">News</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reddit</li>
      <li>Vox</li>
      <li>the Economist</li>
      <li>Five Thirty Eight</li>
      <li>Wall Street Journal</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
