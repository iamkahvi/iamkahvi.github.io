        <p>People usually don’t have time to research all the issues they care about to develop a well-informed opinion. We trust people like journalists or friends to communicate their opinon to us in the hopes that they are more informed than ours.</p>

<p>This is all well and good.</p>

<p>The problem arises when we start treating the majority of people on the Internet like a trusted friend.</p>

<p>A majority of people believing something does not make it true.</p>

<p>Of course, there is a philosophical aspect to this. In some subjective contexts the majority decides what is true or not. Most often though, there is enough research and information out there to make a decision based on facts.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>This all came up when I discovered the controversy around Jordan Peterson.</p>

<p>Peterson is a clinical psychologist and a professor at the University of Toronto.</p>

<p>Sidenote: I am not attempting to defend or justify every controversial stance Peterson has ever taken. This blog post is limited to the subject I am about to bring up.</p>

<p>Jordan Peterson says that there are biological and psychological differences between men and women.</p>

<p>Even just saying that sounds weird.</p>

<p>I think it sounds weird because you, the reader, infered that this claim was equivalent to saying:</p>

<p>Jordan Peterson says that women are biologically and psychologically inferior to men.</p>

<p>THIS IS A DIFFERENT CLAIM.</p>

<p>Stating that two thing are different does not mean that any one of them is superior to the other.</p>
