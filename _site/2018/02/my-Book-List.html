        <p>Preface: Reading a book requires so much of my attention that I never finish books that do not interest me. Therefore, I would honestly recommend all the books listed below. <br /><br />
This list will be updated continuously.</p>

<p>These are the <a href="/bookhighlights.html">highlights</a> from all the books I’ve read on the Kindle.</p>

<h2 id="-this-year-"><u> this year </u></h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>La Belle Sauvage <br />
I had a vague memory of liking the <em>Golden Compass</em> trilogy by the same author (Philip Pullman), which is why I read this book. It took me by surprise. The shift of environment and tone after the first half was sudden, but grew on me. One of my favourite main characters in any book. This story carries with it some deeper moral lessons. Set in a similar world as Harry Potter, but more serious and <em>slightly</em> less supernatural.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/2018/05/on-statistics.html">Naked Statistics</a> <br />
Until reading this book, I never had a rough grasp on statistics. I’ve now realized how important it is. The nature of statistics is counter-intuitive and learning the a few important concepts means defeating misinformation in your daily life. It’s dense though.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Obelisk Gate <br />
The second book in the Broken Earth series. Just as engaging as the first. Sped through this book in two days.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fifth Season <br />
I devoured this book. The first in the Broken Earth series. Starts out rough, but keeps you trapped till the end. The first time in a while I’ve actually been enthralled with fantasy.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Death’s End <br />
A fitting end to an amazing trilogy. This book dives even deeper into fantasy and I believe it completely every step of the way. Contains the most realistic view of our (humanity’s) future, I think.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Dark Forest <br />
The book is better than the first (The Three-Body Problem) in the trilogy. Takes a while to get started, but it’s an amazing ride once it does. If you are at all interested in alien life or astrophysics please read this book.<br />
The idea of a “dark forest” is so overarching and terrifying that it my changed my perception of space.<br />
<br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Three-Body Problem (re-read) <br />
My second favourite science-fiction novel. Involves the Chinese Cultural Revolution, chaotic motion, aliens and a funny cop. Mostly, it keeps engaging you with an overarching mystery. The novel gives you a jarring view of what contact with extra-terrestrial intelligence would feel like.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Annihilation <br />
Unnerving and disturbing. This book is a fictional story that reads like a non-fiction account of reality. Like a black mirror episode in a novel. It’s a quick read too.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red Sparrow <br />
A thriller that delves into Russian culture but mostly keeps you reading it at all costs. A combination of James Patterson and John Le Carré. More Patterson than Le Carré though. Also, recipes are provided at the end of every chapter.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Brave New World <br />
A terrifying view on our dystopian future. Even more striking when considered with technologies like CRISPR and stem cells. Asks many questions about human nature.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pachinko <br />
A book that navigates through three generations of Korean immigrants in Japan during the Second World War. The story struck a chord with me since I come from a family of immigrants. Vividly illustrates the sacrifices that the older generation makes. Really liked this one.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Gentleman in Moscow <br />
Set in the Soviet Union in Moscow in a famous hotel. A former Count lives from middle to old-age and must raise a adopted child within the walls of the hotel. He makes the best of his experience and we see him deal with the existing and developing culture of Russia. A happy ending.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/2017/12/Age-of-Ambition.html">Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China</a> <br />
A useful and striking introduction to modern day China. Illustrates the speed at which China is growing and the costs of that growth. It is long.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-last-year-"><u> last year </u></h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fooled by Randomness <br />
This book was the catalyst for my obsession with Behavioural Economics. Nassim Nicholas Taleb effectively eliminated my trust in the global stock market and everyone who works for it. I do not, however, align with his political beliefs. Taleb lays out how we all operate under frightening amounts of randomness. Highly recommend.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thanks, Obama <br />
Being deeply immersed in US political news has made working in the White House have a magical allure. This book grounded some of my dreams in reality, but also elevated many more. Being surrounded by capable, hopeful idealists who shape the future of the world everyday will never get old.<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Rosie Project <br />
I started this book because Bill Gates recommended it. The whole book doesn’t seem grounded in reality, but that doesn’t make it less interesting. It speaks to how people meet each other and what influences us to start or end relationships.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Three-Body Problem <br />
See above.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Visit from the Goon Squad (twice)<br />
I love this book. Describes the intertwining lives of Bennie and Sasha. The story feels melancholy the whole way through, but there are enough happy moments to pull you through.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Horse Walks Into a Bar <br />
A dark comedy? Takes place during one evening at a comedy club. I feel like I learned something about performance by reading this book. Also hilarious at times.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Undoing Project<br />
A <em>dense</em> book. About the inception of Behavioural Economics. Follows the relationship of two academics.
 <br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>American Kingpin <br />
About the founder of the dark web. Draws some pretty blurry moral lines about why the main character is guilty. Recommended by Casey Neistat.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seveneves (almost) <br />
Bill Gates said he loved this book so I decided to read it. I was about three-quarters of the way through before the whole plot started getting predicable and too disheartening to follow. Interesting concept though.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed <br />
This book is SOOO relevant today. Describes what it feels like to be on the other side of internet outrage. How a mob mentality can lead to terrible consequences.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Swordspoint <br />
As I’ve gotten older, my focus has turned away from fantasy and towards science-fiction. This book is an exception.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Sisters Brothers <br />
Really good book. A Western with real cowboys and guns. Has a good moral at the end.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Psychopath Test<br />
Another Jon Ronson book (SYBPS). I’ve always been fascinated by psychopaths and this book centres around what defines them as such. Do they run the world’s largest corporations? Does their existence always result in a lot of dead people?
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-probably-before-2017-"><u> probably before 2017 </u></h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Goldfinch <br />
This might be my <em>favourite book</em>. I fell in love with every single character. About a boy and his journey through life.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Buried Giant <br />
This book stayed with me. One of the most mature fantasy novels I’ve read. The authors tone is never crowded or too detailed, yet the characters are so easy to empathize with.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Revenant <br />
Brutal, cunning and savage. Leo Dicaprio and bears. If you liked the movie, you’ll love the book because it’s three times as long.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Secret History <br />
By the same author who wrote <em>the Goldfinch</em> (my favourite book). “The story is an inverted detective story, not a whodunit but a <em>whydunit</em>”. &lt;— from Wikipedia
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
