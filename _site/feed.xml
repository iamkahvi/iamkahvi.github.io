        <title>R for Loving Spoonful</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I made some apps with Shiny and R to visualize the data gathered with several programs that were implemented last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://lovingspoonful.shinyapps.io/app1/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;first app&lt;/a&gt; I created to give an easy overview of the food reclamation growth over the course of 12 months. This would help anticipate trends to prepare more effectively for the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I used data from a collection program I help implement in the summer of 2017 to give a helpful visualization of what kinds of food were donated most often and at what frequency. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://lovingspoonful.shinyapps.io/app2/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;app &lt;/a&gt; is here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Volunteer Robot</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the course of summer 2018, I forked and developed a volunteer scheduling database application. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/iamkahvi/volunteers&quot;&gt;README &lt;/a&gt; I created builds on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/playasoft/volunteers&quot;&gt;forked repositories README&lt;/a&gt; and describes usage, features and installation of the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post exists to specify which features I developed alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;table-of-content&quot;&gt;Table of Content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ui-design&quot;&gt;UI Design&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dashboard&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Event Page&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#backend-features&quot;&gt;Backend Features&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Email Notifications&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Hide Empty Days Feature&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Change to Reminder timing through .ENV laravel doc&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Filter by week&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;CSV export for users&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Registering users&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ui-design&quot;&gt;UI Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;event-page&quot;&gt;Event Page&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added a legend to the Event page. I changed the text formatting to make the page more legible.
I changed the date format to make the page more legible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/EventCompare.png&quot; alt=&quot;Compare Event&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dashboard&quot;&gt;Dashboard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using bootstrap list items element, I made the dashboard more legible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DashboardCompare.png&quot; alt=&quot;Compare Dashboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;backend-features&quot;&gt;Backend Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;email-notifications&quot;&gt;Email Notifications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the advice of the original developer, my plan for developing the email notification feature was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a console command which loops through the a table for any shifts starting within the next “hour”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a volunteer has signed up for that slot, send them a notification&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add value to SQL table to prevent further notifications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the command to the Laravel cron so it runs periodically (every 5 minutes? 15 minutes?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach was somewhat inefficient given the Laravel cron would be running continuously when it wouldn’t need to. Scheduling a task immediately when a user signs up instead of iterating through the table continuously would be a better approach. Ultimately I chose to implement the feature as a simple solution using the existing schema as opposed to changing the schema and the controller logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To work through the logic of when to send reminders, I create variables for when the shift starts and when to remind the user for that specific
shift. I do this by creating two &lt;a href=&quot;https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/&quot;&gt;Carbon&lt;/a&gt; dates and add a user-designated amount of hours to the second variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-php highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Cycle through all the slots
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$shifts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$startDate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Carbon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Y-m-d H:i:s'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;strtotime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$shift-&amp;gt;start_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$shift-&amp;gt;start_time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$remindDate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Carbon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Y-m-d H:i:s'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;strtotime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$shift-&amp;gt;start_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$shift-&amp;gt;start_time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Carbon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$remindDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;subHours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'REMIND_HOURS'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the shift starting within the given reminder period using the variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-php highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$remindDate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$startDate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I cycle through all users to find who is registered for the shift in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-php highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$users&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Find user that is registered for this shift
&lt;/span&gt;		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;user_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I notify the user of the shift. I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mailgun.com/email-api&quot;&gt;MailGun api&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/mail&quot;&gt;Laravel&lt;/a&gt; to send the emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-php highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;			
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Notify user of upcoming shift
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;isNotified&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'No'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;notify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;shiftStarting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to prevent the user from getting continuously notified, I created a column in the shifts table to track notification status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-php highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Update isNotified value in SQL database
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'slots'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'id'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'isNotified'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Yes'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hide-empty-days-feature&quot;&gt;Hide Empty Days Feature&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My strategy was to cycle through each day that would be displayed on the event page and check if the day had a shift.
Fortunately, this check was relatively simple after looking into different SQL queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-php highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Pluck all of the shift IDs for this event and check the if any in the schedule start today
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Schedule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;whereIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'shift_id'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$shifts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'dates'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'LIKE'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;%&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Y-m-d'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;%&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;isEmpty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Continue onto the next day
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;addDay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;filter-by-week&quot;&gt;Filter by week&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I’ve had previous experience with Javascript in University so working out the logic for this feature was trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Hide all the days&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'.days .day'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;addClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'hidden'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Convert date to Moment format&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;moment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;moment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Show this one&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Loop through seven days&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        <title>position paper</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been going through old papers of mine recently and this one struck me as interesting enough to share. I wrote a barebones &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/on-behavioural-economics&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;academic&quot;&gt;Kahvi Patel&lt;br /&gt;
Research Paper&lt;br /&gt;
April 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;academic indent&quot;&gt;In the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the separation between scientific and non-scientific theories was vague. The most practical way to distinguish a theory as scientific was to determine whether it was known a posteriori; relied on an empirical method. This meant that astrology, given its vast amounts of observed information, qualified as a scientific theory. In 1919, Karl Popper sought to contrive an alternative separation. Falsifiability was the philosophical term he coined. With this theory, Popper set the groundwork for the modern scientific method and, simultaneously, addressed the problem of induction that had troubled Hume and many other philosophers before him. Popper’s theory of Demarcation, however, not only has its roots in philosophy, but in human nature. As has been the case throughout history, human nature is more prone towards what Popper distinguished as “pseudo-scientific” theories rather than “scientific” ones. Our inherent desires are what make Popper’s theory of Falsification especially relevant; Demarcation is a tool to fight against our own misleading instincts. In order to repress this widespread malpractice, we must employ tactics of doubt exemplified by philosophers like Descartes and Socrates in order to enforce a more logical, and therefore more productive, general consciousness. As Popper originally described in his theory, &lt;em&gt;we must seek falsification&lt;/em&gt;, or doubt, &lt;em&gt;rather than confirmation&lt;/em&gt; in order to prove our own theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;academic indent&quot;&gt;For Popper, the reason for distinguishing between theories was not “ doubting the &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; of those other theories, but something else” (Popper 32). What bothered Popper were the incessant “confirming instances” relating to the “pseudo-scientific theories” in question. Freud’s theory of psychoanalysis, for example, was supported repeatedly by whatever the psychologist theorized. In other words, &lt;em&gt;every event confirmed the theory&lt;/em&gt;. This practice has a flaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;academic&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I may illustrate this by two very different examples of human behavior: that of a man who pushes a child into the water with the intention of drowning it; and that of a man who sacrifices his life in an attempt to save the child. Each of these two cases can be explained with equal ease in Freudian and in Adlerian terms. According to Freud the first man suffered from repression (say, of some component of his Oedipus complex), while the second man had achieved sublimation. According to Adler the first man suffered from feelings of inferiority (producing perhaps the need to prove to himself that he dared to commit some crime), and so did the second man (whose need was to prove to himself that he dared to rescue the child). (Popper 35)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;academic&quot;&gt;This situation demonstrates the ambiguity of Freud’s (and Adler’s) theory. The result, no matter how unexpected or crazy, can always be justified. This method was in direct contrast to another Popper had witnessed; Einstein’s theory of gravitation. Whereas Freud’s theory relied on explanation, Einstein’s relied on prediction. More specifically, one sought &lt;em&gt;confirmation&lt;/em&gt;, the other sought &lt;em&gt;falsification&lt;/em&gt;. Alarmingly though, both relied on empirical evidence and the method of induction, thus classing them both, for now, as scientific theories. Importantly, Popper did not attempt to discredit the validity of Freud’s theory, although he may have done so unconsciously. His intention was merely to distinguish it. The significance of this separation cannot be understated. As history progressed, a scientific method was developed around Popper’s falsifiability and a separation began to emerge between science and others things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;academic indent&quot;&gt;More than just a method for distinction between theories, Falsification has significance in human behavior. In general, humans are programmed to ignore events that do not agree with their beliefs and pay attentions to ones that do. This behavior is called &lt;em&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/em&gt; and has been proven to exist in many studies, the most famous of which is the Wason Selection Task. Feel free to attempt this experiment on friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;academic&quot;&gt;He presented subjects with the three-number sequence 2, 4, 6, and asked them to try and guess the rule generating it. Their method of guessing was to produce other three-number sequences, to which the experimenter would respond &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; depending on whether the new sequences were consistent with the rule. Once confident with their answers, the subjects would formulate the rule. The correct rule was &amp;ldquo;numbers in ascending order,&amp;rdquo; nothing more. Very few subjects discovered it because in order to do so they had to offer a series in descending order (that the experimenter would say &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to). (Taleb 123)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;academic&quot;&gt;This experiment demonstrates our inherent instinct to always seek confirmation for our own hypothesis, or theories, instead or trying to discredit them. Once the subjects had formulated a rule, their only intention became trying to find a pattern that fit it instead of trying to supply a series that was &lt;em&gt;inconsistent&lt;/em&gt; with their hypothesis. Our natural human behavior compels us to seek confirmation. The parallels here are widespread. Today, most people gather their information (and biases) from the news and there is more news today than ever before. The constant news cycle compounds biases. People have access to countless sources of evidence, or &quot;number series&quot;, which they use to confirm their own opinions. It becomes much more difficult to attempt to disprove your own opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;academic indent&quot;&gt;A most poignant example of this behavior of confirmation bias is the political polarization that currently exists in the United States: both sides seek confirmation for their own theories, never falsification. Popper&amp;rsquo;s Demarcation seems to work against human instinct. For instance, Freud&amp;rsquo;s theory of psychoanalysis is more easily understandable than Einstein&amp;rsquo;s theory of gravity and thus more attractive. This inherent preference leads to many human patterns of behavior, such as illusion of control and hindsight bias. When a need to explain something arises, we are predisposed to justify our theory by seeking confirmation instead of testing it. A striking example of this behavior is the justification for the start of World War 1. Clearly, the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and the escalating tension and militarization in various countries might predict international conflict. The ensuing World War seems to have been &lt;em&gt;inevitable&lt;/em&gt; - after the events have transpired. This is an example of hindsight bias. As Niall Ferguson, a professor of history at Harvard, makes clear in his paper &lt;em&gt;The international bond market between the 1848 revolution and the outbreak of the First World War&lt;/em&gt;, the world had not noticed these so-called significant events, as evidenced by the flat lining of war bond prices. &lt;strong&gt;If these hints towards the upcoming conflict were as clear as we now make them out to be, why did the price of war bonds not rise? &lt;/strong&gt;Was there a sudden, universal lack of desire to make profit? or were the events we speak of today &lt;em&gt;not obvious at all&lt;/em&gt;. Clearly, the latter is more in line with human nature. The pseudo-scientific theory suggests that the war started because of an episode of tension and militarization. We feel the need to justify events after the fact in order to reassure ourselves that we will see it coming next time. Yet, until those theories in question can withstand falsification, this practice of explanation is useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;academic indent&quot;&gt;When theories are not tested with falsification, they can lead us to misleading conclusions or a false sense of security. In 470 BC, Socrates exposed society&amp;rsquo;s wrongful act of gathering, spreading and reciting knowledge that had illogical grounds. In what we now call &amp;ldquo;Socratic Dialogue&amp;rdquo;, Socrates reduced his subject&amp;rsquo;s opinions to a single thesis which was often illogical. Through this, he proved the Delphi&amp;rsquo;s prophecy true: he was, in fact, &amp;ldquo;the wisest of men&amp;rdquo;. This title, however, did not originate from vast education or far-reaching experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;academic&quot;&gt;I am wiser than this man; it is likely that neither of us knows anything worthwhile, but he thinks he knows something when he does not, whereas when I do not know, neither do I think I know; so I am likely to be wiser than he to this small extent, that &lt;em&gt;I do not think I know what I do not know&lt;/em&gt;. (Plato 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;academic&quot;&gt;Socrates was merely the only man who knew the extent of his own ignorance. Today, we encounter a similar situation. Many of our generally accepted theories and personal opinions are illogical and/or justified by a flawed method. More importantly though, the vast majority of society &lt;em&gt;does not realize&lt;/em&gt; this. Descartes provides another apt exemplar. His doubt, though undoubtedly extreme, was important to build a foundation of truth upon which the rest of his beliefs were founded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;academic&quot;&gt;It is as though they [my beliefs] had a right to a place in my belief-system as a result of long occupation and the law of custom. These habitual opinions of mine are indeed highly probable; although they are in a sense doubtful, as I have shown, it is more reasonable to believe than to deny them. But if I go on viewing them in that light I shall never get out of the habit of confidently assenting to them. To conquer that habit, therefore, I had better switch right around and pretend (for a while) that these former opinions of mine are utterly false and imaginary. I shall do this until I have something to counter-balance the weight of old opinion, and the distorting influence of habit no longer prevents me from judging correctly. (Descartes 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;academic&quot;&gt;The important parallel here is doubt. To doubt one&amp;rsquo;s own belief is the most basic and true form of falsification. We must take advice from Socrates and Descartes and question our own theories and opinions in order to arrive at the roots of our beliefs. We must acknowledge our own ignorance in order to take the next step towards progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;academic indent&quot;&gt;Popper&amp;rsquo;s philosophy was originally meant to distinguish scientific theories. His philosophy of Demarcation, however, went beyond science, and addressed two methods of thinking. Unfortunately for humanity, we are prone to the less reliable mode of thinking: one that seeks confirmation. This behavior has led to a worrying trend in human history. By analyzing the past and present, we may understand how hindsight bias and the illusion of control reveal themselves in society and how they are the result of instinctual human behavior. With the problem assessed and recognized, we may understand it and endeavor to solve it. Doubt is perhaps the truest form of falsification and should be practiced by individuals today in order to justify beliefs. Unless we begin challenging our beliefs, instead of seeking confirmation of them, progress of all kinds will slow.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>on gladwell</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Malcolm Gladwell hosts a &lt;a href=&quot;http://revisionisthistory.com/seasons?selected=season-3&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, he did an episode on CTE today. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is the reason everyone is scared of football these days: Head trauma leads a bunch of bad stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His thesis, basically, is: “At what point do you have enough proof to act?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a speech given at UPenn in 2013, Gladwell uses the example of coal miners in the 1940s. Coal was an integral part of the economy back then; many working class families were supported by the industry. There were drawbacks though. Namely, workers would cough up black coal dust and generally cough a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For various reasons, people said the coughing was a sign of the respiratory system working &lt;em&gt;correctly&lt;/em&gt; and did not consider negative health impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a statistician came along and &lt;strong&gt;proved&lt;/strong&gt; that inhaling coal dust all day was very bad for you and reduces your life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, in his speech, Malcolm asks the audience “What do you think happened then?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Nothing&lt;/em&gt;” he answers dramatically (it was a rhetorical question).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until 1975 that a general consensus was reached about the dangers of coal mining and action was taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gladwell’s parallel is with football today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He goes on to argue that the students at UPenn should boycott the school’s football game in protest of the University ignoring proof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-have-a-problem-with-his-argument-though&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have a problem with his argument though.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If an adult is aware of the risks of an activity and is not harming others in the process, what right do we have to stop them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question has little to do with football, yet is the core of Gladwell’s argument. &lt;em&gt;Every sport&lt;/em&gt; has different degrees of good and bad depending on who you ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key insight is that the people participating should be the ones to weigh the pros and cons, not us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Society should do everything in its power to provide information to judge the sport with (like studies about CTE), but the &lt;em&gt;decisions made&lt;/em&gt; based on that information are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in society’s control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea of athletes taking this decision into their own hands was never addressed in the podcast. Instead, athletes were only mentioned when the consequences of &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; actions befell &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malcolm strays away from this moral question, or purposefully ignores it, because it is harder to answer than the one he asks in his podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reducing this issue down to right and wrong is reductive and demeans the judgment of football players/responsible adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;this post is incomplete&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>on statistics</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Naked-Statistics-Stripping-Dread-Data/dp/1480590185&quot;&gt;Naked Statistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sidenote: &lt;em&gt;This post is based entirely on what I’ve learned while reading ^that book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three concepts in statistics that are important to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-law-of-large-numbers&quot;&gt;1. Law of Large Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“An important theorem known as the law of large numbers tells us that as the number of trials increases, the average of the outcomes will get closer and closer to its expected value”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is counter intuitive. This is how I think of this theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are flipping a coin 10 times. Imagine the first eight times you flip the coin, it lands on heads. Intuitively, you would assume that the next flip is more likely to land on tails than heads. This is FALSE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time you flip the coin, nothing different is happening. Every flip is a 50/50 chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of your 10 flips, you have landed nine heads and one tail. This doesn’t make sense. If the likelihood of flipping both possibilities is equal, why is the outcome so skewed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because you have witnessed an anomaly. The chances of you hitting nine heads in a row are very small (1/512 or 0.2%). The results you have witnessed are not representative of the true probability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The true probability only emerges as you keep flipping the coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logic behind this is hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, the more time you flip the coin, the less anomalies (like nine heads in a row) will matter to the overall result. Eventually anomalies are drowned out and the true probability can be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chart below illustrates the theory. Every flip, the average of heads is calculated: (number of head flips / total number of flips). According to everything that makes sense, that number should be 0.5 or 1/2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/heads14.png&quot; alt=&quot;Coin Flip Chart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the first 10 trials, the average number of heads fluctuates wildly, from an underrepresentation to an overrepresentation in 10 flips. You can see how if we stopped after just 10 flips, it would be hard to draw a conclusion about the &lt;em&gt;true probability&lt;/em&gt; of this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As more coins are flipped though, the average number of heads move closer to 0.5, which is what probability says it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The law of large numbers explains why casinos always make money in the long run. The probabilities associated with all casino games favor the house (assuming that the casino can successfully prevent blackjack players from counting cards). If enough bets are wagered over a long enough time, the casino will be certain to win more than it loses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wheelan, Charles. “Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-independent-and-dependent-relations&quot;&gt;2. Independent and Dependent Relations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time a coin is flipped heads, the chance of the second flip being heads stays exactly the same. This is called an independent relation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time a car is parked, the chance of the driver getting a parking ticket increases. This is a dependent relation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, we do not realize what event are independent and dependent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classic example is a “hot-hand” in basketball. After a player makes a certain amount of shots in a row, it seems more likely that he will make the next shot. We assume that this is a dependent relation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028585900106&quot;&gt;It isn’t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-percentages&quot;&gt;3. Percentages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More often than not, a percentage is a better way to understand data than an absolute number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at a storefront, I would rather know what &lt;em&gt;percentage&lt;/em&gt; of the price is discounted than an absolute number. Saving $5 on a $10 item is awesome, but saving $5 on a $200 item is shitty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at a company, I would rather know a &lt;em&gt;percentage&lt;/em&gt; for revenue growth rather than an absolute number. Growing yearly revenues from $20 billion to $20.1 billion is not a huge difference, but $100 million in additional revenue &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Percentages give you context for absolute numbers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we should address some fallacies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;1.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Assume that a department store is selling a dress for $100. The assistant manager marks down all merchandise by 25 percent. But then that assistant manager is fired…and the new assistant manager raises all prices by 25 percent. What is the final price of the dress? If you said (or thought) $100, ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you are wrong. Here is what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price was originally $100. Then it was discounted by 25%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25% of $100 is, clearly, $25. Therefore, the new price is $100 - $25 = $75.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the price was raised by 25%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25% of $75 is $18.75. Therefore, the new price is $75 + $18.75 = $93.75.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept is especially important in the stock market:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you buy $50 of Apple stock on Monday. The stock goes down 12% on Tuesday, but then goes up 12% on Wednesday. You do not start Thursday with $50 of Apple stock. You will have less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;2.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The Democrats, who engineered this tax increase, pointed out (correctly) that the state income tax rate was increased by 2 percentage points (from 3 percent to 5 percent). The Republicans pointed out (also correctly) that the state income tax had been raised by 67 percent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.479.3099&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&quot;&gt;Luck versus Skill in the Cross-Section of Mutual Fund Returns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>my book list</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Preface: Reading a book requires so much of my attention that I never finish books that do not interest me. Therefore, I would honestly recommend all the books listed below. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This list will be updated continuously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the &lt;a href=&quot;/bookhighlights.html&quot;&gt;highlights&lt;/a&gt; from all the books I’ve read on the Kindle (I’m really bad at updating this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-this-year-&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; this year &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Looming Tower&lt;br /&gt;
It’s sort of against the rules but I haven’t finished this book yet. I wanted to write about it because it’s the first non-fiction book that has kept me engaged for over a month of regular reading. The book explores Islam, US Policy, personal motivations; and culminates in 9/11. Despite this inevitable conclusion, what keeps me reading is the background leading up to the event and not the event itself. My knowledge surrounding the events leading up to 9/11 involving Bin Laden, Sudan, Yemen and Saudi Arabia was murky and misinformed until I started reading this book.&lt;br /&gt;
(Update: Just finished it)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The English Patient&lt;br /&gt;
Not sure how I got through this book. It has exciting moments, but they are few and far between. This book takes a certain type of focus and patience that I barely have. It’s rewarding by the end though. About a group of people who live in an Italian villa after the War. Explores each of their history, some more than others.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao&lt;br /&gt;
Fun book to read. It goes by fast mostly due to the narrator’s hilarious tone. Follows a family through three generations as they navigate the Dominican Republic and then the United States, but mostly about Oscar Wao. Left me with a melancholy feeling. Important tip: Do not read the introduction, it takes way too long and is discouraging.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Idiot &lt;br /&gt;
This book is dense. It took me a while to finish. I haven’t encountered this type of writing style before. It’s abrupt and unique. I identify with the main character and her setting deeply. &lt;a href=&quot;/_pages/highlights/The-Idiot&quot;&gt;Highlights here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;La Belle Sauvage &lt;br /&gt;
I had a vague memory of liking the &lt;em&gt;Golden Compass&lt;/em&gt; trilogy by the same author (Philip Pullman), which is why I read this book. It took me by surprise. The shift of environment and tone after the first half was sudden, but grew on me. One of my favourite main characters in any book. This story carries with it some deeper moral lessons. Set in a similar world as Harry Potter, but more serious and &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; less supernatural.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/05/on-statistics.html&quot;&gt;Naked Statistics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Until reading this book, I never had a grasp on statistics. I’ve now realized how important it is. The nature of statistics is counter-intuitive and learning the a few important concepts means defeating misinformation in your daily life. It’s dense though.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Obelisk Gate &lt;br /&gt;
The second book in the Broken Earth series. Just as engaging as the first. Sped through this book in two days.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fifth Season &lt;br /&gt;
I devoured this book. The first in the Broken Earth series. Starts out rough, but keeps you trapped till the end. The first time in a while I’ve actually been enthralled with fantasy.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Death’s End &lt;br /&gt;
A fitting end to an amazing trilogy. This book dives even deeper into fantasy and I believe it completely every step of the way. Contains the most realistic view of our (humanity’s) future, I think.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Dark Forest &lt;br /&gt;
The book is better than the first (The Three-Body Problem) in the trilogy. Takes a while to get started, but it’s an amazing ride once it does. If you are at all interested in alien life or astrophysics please read this book.&lt;br /&gt;
The idea of a “dark forest” is so overarching and terrifying that it my changed my perception of space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Three-Body Problem (re-read) &lt;br /&gt;
My second favorite science-fiction novel. Involves the Chinese Cultural Revolution, chaotic motion, aliens and a funny cop. Mostly, it keeps engaging you with an overarching mystery. The novel gives you a jarring view of what contact with extra-terrestrial intelligence would feel like.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Annihilation &lt;br /&gt;
Unnerving and disturbing. This book is a fictional story that reads like a non-fiction account of reality. Like a black mirror episode in a novel. It’s a quick read too.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red Sparrow &lt;br /&gt;
A thriller that delves into Russian culture but mostly keeps you reading it at all costs. A combination of James Patterson and John Le Carré. More Patterson than Le Carré though. Also, recipes are provided at the end of every chapter.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Brave New World &lt;br /&gt;
A terrifying view on our dystopian future. Even more striking when considered with technologies like CRISPR and stem cells. Asks many questions about human nature.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pachinko &lt;br /&gt;
A book that navigates through three generations of Korean immigrants in Japan during the Second World War. The story struck a chord with me since I come from a family of immigrants. Vividly illustrates the sacrifices that the older generation makes. Really liked this one.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Gentleman in Moscow &lt;br /&gt;
Set in the Soviet Union in Moscow in a famous hotel. A former Count lives from middle to old-age and must raise a adopted child within the walls of the hotel. He makes the best of his experience and we see him deal with the existing and developing culture of Russia. A happy ending.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/12/Age-of-Ambition.html&quot;&gt;Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
A useful and striking introduction to modern day China. Illustrates the speed at which China is growing and the costs of that growth. It is long.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-last-year-&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; last year &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fooled by Randomness &lt;br /&gt;
This book was the catalyst for my obsession with Behavioural Economics. Nassim Nicholas Taleb effectively eliminated my trust in the global stock market and everyone who works for it. I do not, however, align with his political beliefs. Taleb lays out how we all operate under frightening amounts of randomness. Highly recommend.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks, Obama &lt;br /&gt;
Being deeply immersed in US political news has made working in the White House have a magical allure. This book grounded some of my dreams in reality, but also elevated many more. Being surrounded by capable, hopeful idealists who shape the future of the world everyday will never get old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Rosie Project &lt;br /&gt;
I started this book because Bill Gates recommended it. The whole book doesn’t seem grounded in reality, but that doesn’t make it less interesting. It speaks to how people meet each other and what influences us to start or end relationships.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Three-Body Problem &lt;br /&gt;
See above.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Visit from the Goon Squad (twice)&lt;br /&gt;
I love this book. Describes the intertwining lives of Bennie and Sasha. The story feels melancholy the whole way through, but there are enough happy moments to pull you through.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Horse Walks Into a Bar &lt;br /&gt;
A dark comedy? Takes place during one evening at a comedy club. I feel like I learned something about performance by reading this book. Also hilarious at times.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Undoing Project&lt;br /&gt;
A &lt;em&gt;dense&lt;/em&gt; book. About the inception of Behavioural Economics. Follows the relationship of two academics.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;American Kingpin &lt;br /&gt;
About the founder of the dark web. Draws some pretty blurry moral lines about why the main character is guilty. Recommended by Casey Neistat.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seveneves (almost) &lt;br /&gt;
Bill Gates said he loved this book so I decided to read it. I was about three-quarters of the way through before the whole plot started getting predicable and too disheartening to follow. Interesting concept though.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed &lt;br /&gt;
This book is SOOO relevant today. Describes what it feels like to be on the other side of internet outrage. How a mob mentality can lead to terrible consequences.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swordspoint &lt;br /&gt;
As I’ve gotten older, my focus has turned away from fantasy and towards science-fiction. This book is an exception.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Sisters Brothers &lt;br /&gt;
Really good book. A Western with real cowboys and guns. Has a good moral at the end.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Psychopath Test&lt;br /&gt;
Another Jon Ronson book (SYBPS). I’ve always been fascinated by psychopaths and this book centres around what defines them as such. Do they run the world’s largest corporations? Does their existence always result in a lot of dead people?
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-probably-before-2017-&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; probably before 2017 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Goldfinch &lt;br /&gt;
This might be my &lt;em&gt;favourite book&lt;/em&gt;. I fell in love with every single character. About a boy and his journey through life.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Buried Giant &lt;br /&gt;
This book stayed with me. One of the most mature fantasy novels I’ve read. The authors tone is never crowded or too detailed, yet the characters are so easy to empathize with.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Revenant &lt;br /&gt;
Brutal, cunning and savage. Leo Dicaprio and bears. If you liked the movie, you’ll love the book because it’s three times as long.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Secret History &lt;br /&gt;
By the same author who wrote &lt;em&gt;the Goldfinch&lt;/em&gt; (my favourite book). “The story is an inverted detective story, not a whodunit but a &lt;em&gt;whydunit&lt;/em&gt;”. &amp;lt;— from Wikipedia
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will finish these summaries&lt;/em&gt;

        <title>A Gentleman In Moscow</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Gentleman in Moscow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
by Amor Towles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-summary-&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; Summary: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Gentleman In Moscow revolves around the romantic idea of a perfect gentleman and a splendid hotel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book begins with a description of your classic idea of a gentleman; tall, well-mannered, polite, gracious. Age: about 40? &lt;br /&gt;
After the Bolshevik revolution, he is forced to move out of his suite in the hotel in which he has been living for the past 10 years (?). The Count is relocated in a smaller room on a lower floor and is placed under house arrest. From this day forward, he cannot leave the hotel. &lt;br /&gt;
There are various descriptions of the important locations and characters in the hotel: Emile, the chef; Andrey, the maitre’d. &lt;br /&gt;
Over the course of his time at the hotel the Count meets many new people, who eventually all play an important role later in his life. &lt;br /&gt;
Foremost among those people is Nina whom the Count meets when Nina is 6? They develop a friendship and over the years become close confidants as they explore the hotel together. Nina eventually leaves the hotel with her family. &lt;br /&gt;
The Count remains at the hotel, striking up an affair with a movie star, Anna, and developing more familiar relationships with the staff of the hotel various sub-businesses; restaurant, bar, barbershop, tailor, etc. He almost commits suicide but is convinced (indirectly) by a blind man he had made friends with not to. &lt;br /&gt;
Many years later, Nina returns to the hotel with her child, Sophia, age six. Nina tells the Count that she must leave for Serbia to find her husband who has gone missing. She implores the Count to take Sophia for what she imagines will only be two or three weeks. &lt;br /&gt;
Sophia remains under the care of the Count for much longer than that. Sophia begins referring to the Count as “papa” and their relationship develops from something polite and cold to a warm and loving relationship. &lt;br /&gt;
Sophia grows into a smart, driven, beautiful young woman and eventually leaves the hotel to perform with the Moscow Orchestra (she has become an accomplished pianist). The Orchestra performs in Paris and while she is there, Sophia escapes to the American Embassy (under the specific direction of her and the Count’s plan) to meet with another one of the Count’s aquaintances become friend, Richard, who is the American Ambassador to France (?). &lt;br /&gt;
The book ends with the Count escaping the hotel after saying goodbye to all his friends there and returning to his childhood town. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;-my-takeaways-&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; My takeaways &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book helps the reader to appreciate the culture and history of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book argues that a gentleman remains a gentleman no matter their nation of heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It offers an interesting perspective on the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many life lessons are delivered. This is one of the easier to quote ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“ The first was that if one did not master one’s circumstances, one was bound to be mastered by them; and the second was Montaigne’s maxim that the surest sign of wisdom is constant cheerfulness. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>thoughts on 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t really know what to think about 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are a bunch of thoughts that have nothing to do with the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about education and what the value of a degree is, and the following seems relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-david-foster-wallaces-kenyon-college-commencement-speech&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;From David Foster Wallace’s Kenyon College Commencement Speech&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here is the real, no bullshit value of your liberal arts education is supposed to be about: how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable adult life dead, unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default setting of being uniquely, completely, imperially alone day in and day out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It’s the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It’s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness. Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they’re evil or sinful, it’s that they’re unconscious. They are default settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe that relates to my next point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;are-you-day-trading-from-seth-godins-blog&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Are you day trading? (From Seth Godin’s Blog)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The volatility of bitcoin turns the people who own it into addicts. At any given moment, it’s up $100 or down a thousand.&lt;br /&gt;
When it’s up, you think you’re brilliant, that you somehow had something to do with it.
And when it’s down, the world is about to implode.&lt;br /&gt;
Most people don’t day trade bitcoin, but all of us day trade something. We’re hooked into something volatile, easily measured and emotional. We overdo our response to news, good or bad, and let it distract us from the long-term job of living a useful life.&lt;br /&gt;
Your SEO results, your Facebook likes, the look on your boss’s face when she gets back from a meeting–all of these things are rife with opportunities for day trading.&lt;br /&gt;
It’ll be volatile with or without your help. Better to set it aside and get back to the real work of making a difference instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a rant :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of a business is to make a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A business employs people because they do work and make the business profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You work towards a University degree because you will do work better and will be more attractive to businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, all that matters is &lt;i&gt;results&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the point. Instead of proving your value through getting a degree, prove your value by getting results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get page views, get purchase orders, show your understanding of how consumers think and how to take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are very few people who teach at Universities who have attained results. They have been taught about results, they talk about results, they think about results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they never get results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the only way to absolutely prove you get results, is to get results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why I am so unsure of this University thing. No one can prove they know how to get results by teaching. Only by doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary: Success in University does not directly translate to success in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creative-people-have-a-weird-job&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Creative people have a weird job&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you create things that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think are cool, or do you create things that you think &lt;em&gt;other people&lt;/em&gt; will like. In more abstract terms, it’s the difference between staying true to yourself and selling out, right? But how do you define the line between your audience’s taste and your own. Presumably, a great creator would accumulate such a unique audience that there would be no difference between their two tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s a matter of having a constant conversation with your audience. Each party challenging the other the create new and better things. The difference between that and losing your own say in the things you create is a blurry one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume the only absolute solution is to create as if your audience is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;this post is incomplete&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;other than the blatant racism and subtle sexism, breakfast at tiffany’s is a film that spoke to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i haven’t had much experience with relationships, but I’ve often come across women who have an almost identical nature as audrey hepburn’s character did in the movie. free-spirited, wild, not normal. the moment things got regular, they force change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i admire that quality. at this point in my life, i loathe routine even though i live by it for the most part. as often as i can, i try to break patterns and try new things, although it is usually motivated by interest and not to force change for the sake of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;certainly, living the way audrey’s character does has a undeniable romantic appeal. those few people i encounter who drift into my life and astonish me only to vanish just as quickly are impossible not to admire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the way connections are made which seem deep on one side, but superficial on another is frightening. i think its every persons fear that a friendship isn’t reciprocated with the same enthusiasm on the other end. in Aubrey’s case, it seems like that fear always comes to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i guess it isn’t really her fault. the fact that her life is spent quickly building relationships then moving upwards from them may not be her fault. i think the movie makes it out to be her personality and not malicious intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the idea of entering someone’s life, astonishing them, then leaving just as quickly is interesting to me. not only for the result on my own life, but also the lasting impression it would leave on said person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;efficient is another way to look at this. in the most optimistic sense, audrey’s character is getting everything out of a relationship in a short amount of time instead of a long one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or maybe the truth is entirely different. just because a person astonishes and surprises you, does not mean that the resulting relationship was “deep”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;presumably, a deep relationship comes from length and not intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;maybe that is the crux of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for her whole life, aubrey’s character lived intense and short relationships which is a admirable lifestyle as perceived from the outside. admirable because passion is more easily noticed than depth. by the end of the movie though, she decides to do the opposite and develop a long and perhaps less intense relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;although, i am implying a trade-off here. passionate/exciting relationships are short and “deep” ones are long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;both of these claims are probably not entirely true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a deep connection can come out of a short encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the other side i am not so sure.&lt;/p&gt;
