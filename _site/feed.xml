        <title>breakfast at tiffany’s</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;other than the blatant racism and subtle sexism, breakfast at tiffany’s is a film that spoke to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i haven’t had much experience with relationships, but I’ve often come across women who have an almost identical nature as audrey hepburn’s character did in the movie. free-spirited, wild, not normal. the moment things got regular, they force change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i admire that quality. at this point in my life, i loathe routine even though i live by it for the most part. as often as i can, i try to break patterns and try new things, although it is usually motivated by interest and to force change for the sake of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;certainly, living the way audrey’s character does has a undeniable romantic appeal. those few people i encounter who drift into my life and astonish me only to vanish just as quickly are impossible not to admire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the way connections are made which seem deep on one side, but superficial on another is frightening. i think its every persons fear that a friendship isn’t reciprocated with the same enthusiasm on the other end. in Aubrey’s case, it seems like that fear always comes to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i guess it isn’t really her fault. the fact that her life is spent quickly building relationships then moving upwards from them may not be her fault. i think the movie makes it out to be her personality and not malicious intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the idea of entering someone’s life, astonishing them, then leaving just as quickly is interesting to me. not only for the result on my own life, but also the lasting impression it would leave on said person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;efficient is another way to look at this. in the most optimistic sense, audrey’s character is getting everything out of a relationship in a short amount of time instead of a long one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or maybe the truth is entirely different. just because a person astonishes and surprises you, does not mean that the resulting relationship was “deep”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;presumably, a deep relationship comes from length and not intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;maybe that is the crux of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for her whole life, aubrey’s character lived intense and short relationships which is a admirable lifestyle as perceived from the outside. admirable because passion is more easily noticed than depth. by the end of the movie though, she decides to do the opposite and develop a long and perhaps less intense relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;although, i am implying a trade-off here. passionate/exciting relationships are short and “deep” ones are long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;both of these claims are probably not entirely true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a deep connection can come out of a short encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the other side i am not so sure.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A book review?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt; by Evan Osnos &lt;br /&gt;^ is a book I’ve recently read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most books I read don’t stay with me for long. This one is no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time though, I read on a Kindle and highlighted things so that I might remember the entire book in more detail. This post is my attempt at summarizing the book using those highlighted quotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has always been a mystery to me. The variety of culture found in the United States is so broad that I find trouble believing the one-dimensional image I have in my head of China. A country with arguably the most important economy yet I have not idea how it’s run, it’s history, the source of its growth, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the idea that they’re a communist country? Doesn’t the West hate Commies? Why are we okay with this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book was easy to read for a couple reasons. First, it is an interesting introduction to a country I know nothing about. It follows personal journeys of people instead of talking about numbers and economics and boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, it is somewhat reassuring. Here’s a fact that has consistently stuck in my mind: There are more MBA’s graduating every year in China than there are undergrads graduating in the US. That’s ridiculous. Especially when there is this pessimistic outlook on the job market. China is a terrifying competitor, compounded by the fact that the US President is practically handing them the role of international leadership. That is the interesting part of this book though. You are presented with their insane economic success but also China’s flaws and the negative aspect of their ridiculous growth. Notably how there entire society is more “controlled”. It often seems like a Black Mirror episode. China spends more money on domestic security than national defence. Bus routes get rerouted so citizens won’t pass the courthouse when contested cases are in session. Creepy stuff. My optimism comes from the fact that the West has freedom and China doesn’t. That inevitably changes culture and behaviour of people and that is clearly illustrated in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It boils down to the fact that I am not jealous of anyone in China. The feeling of powerlessness against the ruling party is something I am terrified of and hope to never experience. The Politburo seems to have a much lower threshold than America for throwing a hood over someones head and locking them up forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just seems like the trade off wasn’t worth it. Sure your country is arguably the largest economic superpower in the world but where is your ~culture~? It just seems bland. Relevant quote from the book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let your public self be like rice in a dinner: bland and inconspicuous, taking on the flavors of its surroundings while giving off no flavor of its own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;She was also moved by the way he cared for his widowed father. On their second date, he proposed marriage to her on the subway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t bother looking for favoritism or nepotism here. Work hard, and your success will be clear in your results. Don’t bother kissing ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’d rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the more violent the body contact of the sports you watch, the lower the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cheung Yan,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the quantity of money passing through Macau would exceed that of Las Vegas six times over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Chinese were found to take consistently larger risks than Americans of comparable wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Li urged us to soak our feet in hot water before bed—he said it would help with jet lag&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Department had a breadth of authority over the realm of ideas in China that Anne-Marie Brady, a scholar who studied it, compared to the “Vatican’s influence over the Catholic world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[The Department] encompassed, by one estimate, a propaganda officer for every one hundred Chinese citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was more important than ever, Party scholars pointed out, to “make their thinking conform with the dominant ideology, thereby standardizing people’s behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hu Shuli had a singular profile. She was an incurable muckraker, but had cultivated first-name familiarity with some of China’s most powerful Party leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Her interviewees included a promising young cadre in city government whose openness to the free market had earned him the nickname the God of Wealth. His name was Xi Jinping, and years later he would become the president of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Almost nine out of ten Chinese approved of the way things were going in their country—the highest share of any of the twenty-four countries surveyed that spring by the Pew Research Center. (In the United States, by comparison, just two out of ten voiced such approval.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The United States brags about its political system, but the president says one thing during the election, something else when he takes office, something else at midterm, and something else when he leaves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, the culture of the Web was an almost perfect opposite of the culture of the Communist Party: Chinese leaders cherished solemnity, conformity, and secrecy; the Web sanctified informality, newness, and, above all, disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Authenticity, or the appearance of it, had become the rarest of assets in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When the Party praised “democracy,” it meant “democratic centralism,” the concept of debate within its own ranks, and unquestioning adherence to final decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The instinct to shield the public from unflattering facts was absurdly at odds with the openness and sophistication in other parts of Chinese life, and it seemed to cheapen what ordinary Chinese people had worked so hard to achieve.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The night before his trial, his lawyer was detained; Chen was represented by court-appointed attorneys, who called no witnesses. He was found guilty of destroying property and disrupting traffic and was sentenced to four years and three months in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By the middle of April, human rights groups were calling it the largest crackdown on expression since Tiananmen Square two decades earlier. Two hundred people had been questioned or placed under house arrest; another thirty-five were presumed to be in detention. The list included not only old-line dissidents, but also social media celebrities and journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the first time in history, the People’s Republic was spending more on domestic security than on foreign defense; it was devoting more money to policing and surveilling its own people than it was on defending against threats from abroad.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How much of the drama was light and how much was dark? How much was about opportunity and how much was about repression?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why the most famous image from China in the past thirty years was not of its economic rise but of the man standing in front of the tank near Tiananmen Square.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A study found that 70 percent of Chinese social media users relied on social media as their main source of news; in America, that number was 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ugly side of China’s growth is perhaps most clearly illustrated by the train crash. Its cause was completely preventable, which only served to propel the incident to an even higher level of fame. The core problem is illustrated below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The maintenance people weren’t familiar enough with their jobs, and they didn’t want to stop the train. They didn’t dare.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;^ China’s growth takes president over everything, even citizens own safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China’s most famous public works project was an ecosystem almost perfectly hospitable to corruption—opaque, unsupervised, and overflowing with cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Central government was worried that if he really succeeded in giving out four hundred million in bribes he would essentially have bought a government position. That’s why he was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Public servants—officially earning twenty or thirty thousand dollars a year—became such frequent shoppers at Gucci and Louis Vuitton that high-end boutiques in Beijing ran out of stock whenever the National People’s Congress was in session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In weak democracies, people paid their way into office by buying votes; in a state where there were no votes to buy, you paid the people who doled out the jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruption bruuh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By 2012 the richest seventy members of China’s national legislature had a net worth of almost ninety billion dollars—more than ten times the combined net worth of the entire U.S. Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bo Xilai looked like a movie star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Scandal was becoming the backbeat to China’s rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oven if local bureaucrats were corrupt, its top leaders so exemplified wisdom, justice, and meritocracy that dissent and direct elections were superfluous and obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wealth was hard for the Party to explain, so it decided not to try: within twenty-four hours, the government blocked the Bloomberg website—it would stay blocked in China for the foreseeable future—and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It would cost the company millions in lost sales and advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“He and his family can’t stay in China. It’s no longer safe,” she said. “Something will happen. It will look like an accident. Nobody will know what happened. He’ll just be found dead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The New York Times relied on corporate records to calculate that in the years that Prime Minister Wen Jiabao was in office, his family amassed assets worth $2.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When the rules favor the rule-makers, they are applied; when they do not, they are ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inequality index:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(An independent calculation put the figure at 0.61, higher than the level in Zimbabwe.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People had a surprisingly high tolerance for the rise of the plutocracy. What they resented were the obstacles that prevented them from joining it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In all, authorities executed at least fourteen yuan billionaires in the span of eight years, on charges ranging from pyramid schemes to murder for hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relation to FOXCON and the suicide nets, etc:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Outsiders were quick to imagine a sweatshop, but this explanation was not quite right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All websites are not to repost the news headlined, “UN Releases World Happiness Report, and China Ranks No. 112.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Foshan is a market town, the home of enormous open-air emporiums, one after another: Iron and Steel World and Flower and Plant World and Children’s Clothing Town, which sells enough clothes each year to dress every kid in America, twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Instantly, the story of the seventeen passersby began to spread across China, and it provoked a surge of self-recrimination. The writer Zhang Lijia asked, “How can we possibly win respect and play the role of a world leader if this is a nation with 1.4 billion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the years of the boom, people had picked up more reasons to fear the law than to trust it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How could China ever hope to invent the next big thing, the next Facebook, if it didn’t dare to let its people use this one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A terrifying illustration of the governments control. Not quite blatant oppression, but a more quiet insidious suppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The city diverted bus routes to bypass the courthouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Racism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In Beijing, some shopkeepers hung signs in their windows like this one, in English, at a restaurant: THIS SHOP DOES NOT RECEIVE THE JAPANESE, THE PHILIPPINES, THE VIETNAMESE AND DOG. In this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When Zhai Xiaobing, a man who worked at an investment fund in Beijing, tweeted a geeky joke that compared the meeting to a new apocalypse movie, he was arrested and held for three weeks.
^ Three weeks for  tweet???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The windows of public buses were taped shut. The city banned pleasure boats from the lakes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the only Tibetans at the Great Hall were members of the official Tibetan delegation, who brought news that Lhasa, their capital, had been voted “the happiest city in China”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;conducted a “Chinese Dream” survey, asking whether people supported one-party rule and believed in socialism, 80 percent of the three thousand respondents replied “no” to both questions,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2017/12/A-book-review</guid>

        <title>flights</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Boarding a flight is kinda weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the AC105 has an absurd amount of people onboard. 
I wonder if the rising property value of a city can be associated with how many people regularly commute there. The correlation is present for this flight. The line to board was the longest I’ve ever seen and rent in Vancouver makes me want to cry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While walking from the terminal to the plane in that tunnel thing, I pass by a separate door used only by business class passengers. This is the first in a series of disappointments.
As I enter the plane and recall Dante’s Divine Comedy; Inferno, Purgatory and Paradise. Though not in that order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walk past Paradise first. What I assume to be aggressively rich people are already seated and have to endure the somewhat aggressive stares of all the lower class plebs walking past them. It this their punishment for paying such an absurd amount of money for a plane ticket? Wouldn’t they rather board after everyone else so as to avoid the awkward stares? I would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Premium economy is after, which I suppose is Purgatory. The seats evolve from thrones to generous car seats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is “preferred economy” which only serves to dishearten me more as I realize how low I’ve stooped to get on this plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That worry lasts only 5 seconds, or thirty depending on how efficient the people ahead of you are at packing the overhead compartments, until I arrive at the sea of regular economy seats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I glance over the faces of the plebs. Given their location in the plane, they seem extraordinarily dignified and almost disgusted by their surroundings.  I can’t help but read the thoughts behind their expressions of misery: “Aren’t I special enough to be in the front?”, “Don’t I deserve it?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plane is a unique situation where middle to high-income people are reduced to taking common transport, like a bus. Of course, being on a plane is nothing like being on a bus, but that’s not the point. 
I’m trying to say that the type of middle-income people who don’t usually take public transportation are &lt;em&gt;forced&lt;/em&gt; to if they want to travel by air. Everyone is reduced to the same level, rid of income separation for the most part. The size of your seat is the same as your neighbour’s, no matter your background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you are in Purgatory or Paradise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The act of sharing space with a stranger is so uncomfortable to me that I would assume most people within their means would pay to be rid of that experience. That seems to be the problem. Our society nowadays seems hell-bent on not caring about anything and remaining distant from everyone (very general statement that I will not justify).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why it seems weird that all these people have agreed to exist in these circumstances for five hours. Those two things don’t make sense together. 
I guess I’ve found the exact amount of value people place on their personal comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said, the actual economy class seat isn’t all that bad. I’m 5’9” and 150 lbs and can sit somewhat comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than your physical dimensions though, I think mastering the politics around seat manipulation are the key to a comfortable flight. Notably, armrest control and seat back position. My answers for both are simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the seat back. You have every right to lean your seat back as much as you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some circumstances a full seat recline would be strange, as is exemplified by the passenger in front of me who is taking a nap at 45 degrees as the flight crew is walking by with lunch, but never unacceptable. The button is there for a reason and it’s stupid not to use it. There is not doubt it causes discomfort for your behind neighbour, as I am experiencing now, but that can always be somewhat alleviated with them reclining their own seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armrests are slightly more difficult. As in most situations, I notice that older people assume the right to them immediately. Ageism. The key here is persistence. Find a purchase on the armrest and stay there. That is assuming the middle, and most valuable position, is not taken yet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>intro</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve come to realize that I am not educated enough about most subjects for anyone to take my opinion seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I can offer is my perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is not to educate or to persuade. Only to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;em&gt;facts&lt;/em&gt; presented in any of these post are inaccurate, please send me an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear: On issues other than how to graduate from high school and hair care, my opinions shouldn’t be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>why keep talking?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;this post is incomplete&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two questions that I don’t know the answer to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why do we keep theorizing about why the 2016 election turned out the way it did?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why am I so much more involved in the US political system than my own?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;1.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never has something been so publicized. This orange buffoon was somehow always on a TV. Obviously I never thought he would be elected. In fact, I would’ve bet a lot of money on him losing the primary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, then he won all of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately after there came the speculation. It usually starts with a well-intentioned discussion of politics that devolves into people trying to justify why he won:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sexism?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Racism?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The establishment?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two party system?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Populism?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Angry middle class?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Political incorrectness?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Television presence?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Media attention?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it was the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the point is WHO CARES? Until we figure out how to make a truth serum and chem trail into the lungs of every American citizen, there is not concrete way to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-will-never-know-why-trump-won-the-2016-election&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will never know why Trump won the 2016 election.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why keep talking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;2.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pay more attention to US politics than I do Canadian politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naming the speaker of the house, senate majority and minority leader, secretary of state, defence, energy, education and the vice-president is easy, yet naming anyone other than Justin Trudeau in the Canadian executive branch is impossible. Is it even called an executive branch here? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justifying my seemingly extreme interest in US politics is difficult. Am I engaged because these policies and changes in leadership could affect my own life? No. Although they may have a vague effect on me, it is unreasonable to think that anything other than a declaration of war by the US would be directly relevant to me. 
That is not to say that US politics are not relevant to me &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;, the point is that there are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; more relevant things I could be paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real reason why I pay an unreasonable amount of attention to US politics is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It’s entertainment that makes you feel smart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Almost all of what I pay attention to will not affect me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I rarely learn more than the headline, and almost never delve into the actually policy at hand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More often than not, I do not learn anything from the news.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I learn on a week to week basis is basically the equivalent of a Stephen Colbert monologue. I remember the headlines, forget the policy and get some entertainment out of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question: Why don’t I follow Canadian politics just as attentively?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: The US has a sophisticated media infrastructure built around making politics entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before it was the president’s &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; to be entertaining, the media made politics entertaining on its own. Remember Obama’s Khaki suit? Or the birth certificate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why doesn’t Canada have the same entertainment infrastructure? Where is our Stephen Colbert monologue making fun of Justin Trudeau’s socks or something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasons why there isn’t entertainment focused around Canadian politics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The events happening aren’t as exciting?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People in Canada are not interested in politics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are less people in general, less potential viewers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidenote: The first reason might cause the following one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A misconception is that an audience for Canadian politics doesn’t exist. If the way the news is presented is entertaining, an audience will develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example #1: me. Why am I consuming so much US political news? Because of the way it is presented. There is almost no logical reason why I should be as engaged as I am in the Virginia Governor’s Race, but I’m refreshing the polls right now all the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forms of media about politics that I consume:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;podcasts&quot;&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pod Save America&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The Ezra Klein Show&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This American Life&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Revisionist History&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;On The Media&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Stay Tuned&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt;Youtube&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Phillip Defranco&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;John Oliver&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Stephen Colbert&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Samantha Bee&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Seth Myers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;news&quot;&gt;News&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Reddit&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Vox&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the Economist&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Five Thirty Eight&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be continued,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or deleted???&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;this post is incomplete&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A culture tied to an object so completely, they become impossible to separate. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skateboard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soccer ball?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iPhone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Breakdancing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Graffiti&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is just here to remind me to write about this&lt;/p&gt;
