I’ve come to realize that I am not educated enough about most subjects for anyone to take my opinion seriously. 

All I can offer is my perspective.

This blog is not to educate or to persuade. Only to share.

Whether my thoughts influence opinions or not is completely relative to the reader. 

Additionally, if the *facts* presented in any of these post are inaccurate, please send me an email.

To be clear: My opinion on most issues shouldn’t be taken seriously.
