I want to make some charts about my running habits using the Strava API and chart.js

I started running cross-country in elementary school and it sucked. It was a combination of boredom and exhaustion. Also, the stars were so much better than me it made no sense.

I started running regularly in 2017 in my first year at University in Halifax. That year, like many other freshman boys, I was obsessed with fitness partly for the intrinsic benefits and partly out of vanity. 
I decided to spend a couple hours in the gym and run pretty frequently. 
I started running in the evenings, which I preferred because the streets were mostly empty.

In my mind, there are only two times of the day to run from your home. Either leave before 8AM or after sunset in the evening.
