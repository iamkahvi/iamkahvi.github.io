I want to make some charts about my running habits using the Strava API and chart.js

I started running cross-country in elementary school and it sucked. It was a combination of boredom and exhaustion. Also, the stars were so much better than me it made no sense.

I started running regularly in 2017 in my first year at University in Halifax. That year, like many other freshman boys, I was obsessed with fitness partly for the intrinsic benefits and partly out of vanity. 
I decided to spend a couple hours in the gym and run pretty frequently. 
I started running in the evenings, which I preferred because the streets were mostly empty.

I like running al

In my mind, there are only two times of the day to run from your home. Either leave before 8AM or after sunset in the evening.
