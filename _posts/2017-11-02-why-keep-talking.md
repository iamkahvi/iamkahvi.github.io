***this post is incomplete***

Two questions that I don't know the answer to:
1. Why do we keep theorizing about why the 2016 election turned out the way it did?
2. Why am I so much more involved in the US political system than my own?

# 1.

Never has something been so publicized. This orange buffoon was somehow always on a TV. Obviously I never thought he would be elected. In fact, I would’ve bet a lot of money on him losing the primary.

Anyway, then he won all of it.

Almost immediately after there came the speculation. It usually starts with a well-intentioned discussion of politics that devolves into people trying to justify why he won: 

What is
- Sexism?
- Racism?
- The establishment?
- Two party system?
- Populism?
- Angry middle class?
- Political incorrectness?
- Television presence?
- Media attention?

I think it was the media.

But the point is WHO CARES? Until we figure out how to make a truth serum and chem trail into the lungs of every American citizen, there is not concrete way to know. 

Main point:

### **We will never know why Trump won the 2016 election.**

Why keep talking?


# 2.

I pay more attention to US politics than I do Canadian politics. 

Naming the speaker of the house, senate majority and minority leader, secretary of state, defence, energy, education and the vice-president is easy, yet naming anyone other than Justin Trudeau in the Canadian executive branch is impossible. Is it even called an executive branch here? I don’t know. 

Justifying my seemingly extreme interest in US politics is difficult. Am I engaged because these policies and changes in leadership could affect my own life? No. Although they may have a vague effect on me, it is unreasonable to think that anything other than a declaration of war by the US would be directly relevant to me. 
That is not to say that US politics are not relevant to me *at all*, the point is that there are *many* more relevant things I could be paying attention to. 

The real reason why I pay an unreasonable amount of attention to US politics is:

<b>It’s entertainment that makes you feel smart.</b>

This is why:

1. Almost all of what I pay attention to will not affect me.
2. I rarely learn more than the headline, and almost never delve into the actually policy at hand.
3. More often than not, I do not learn anything from the news.

What I learn on a week to week basis is basically the equivalent of a Stephen Colbert monologue. I remember the headlines, forget the policy and get some entertainment out of the process.

Question: Why don’t I follow Canadian politics just as attentively?

Answer: The US has a sophisticated media infrastructure built around making politics entertaining. 

Before it was the president’s *intent* to be entertaining, the media made politics entertaining on its own. Remember Obama’s Khaki suit? Or the birth certificate? 

Why doesn’t Canada have the same entertainment infrastructure? Where is our Stephen Colbert monologue making fun of Justin Trudeau’s socks or something?

Reasons why there isn’t entertainment focused around Canadian politics:

- The events happening aren’t as exciting?
- People in Canada are not interested in politics
- There are less people in general, less potential viewers

Sidenote: The first reason might cause the following one.

A misconception is that an audience for Canadian politics doesn’t exist. If the way the news is presented is entertaining, an audience will develop. 

Example #1: me. Why am I consuming so much US political news? Because of the way it is presented. There is almost no logical reason why I should be as engaged as I am in the Virginia Governor’s Race, but I’m refreshing the polls right now all the same.

Forms of media about politics that I consume:

- ### Podcasts 
	* Pod Save America
	* The Ezra Klein Show
	* This American Life
	* Revisionist History
	* On The Media
	* Stay Tuned

- ### Youtube 
	* Phillip Defranco
	* John Oliver
	* Stephen Colbert
	* Samantha Bee
	* Seth Myers

- ### News 
	* Reddit
	* Vox
	* the Economist
	* Five Thirty Eight 
	* Wall Street Journal
