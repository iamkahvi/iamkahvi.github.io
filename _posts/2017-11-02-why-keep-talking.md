***this post is incomplete***

Two questions that I don't know the answer to:
1. Why do we keep theorizing about why the 2016 election turned out the way it did?
2. Why am I so much more involved in the US political system than my own?

1.

Annoyance. Being virtually forced to follow the 2016 election. Entertaining at first, then annoying, then dreadful. Elections are always a pain. This one was different. Never has something been so publicized. I endured. Kept watching. Kept rolling my eyes. Knowing he could never win. 

Then he won. 

Now everyone theorizes.
- Sexism?
- Racism?
- The establishment?
- Two party system?
- Populism?
- Angry middle class?
- Political incorrectness?
- Television presence?
- Media attention?

I do too. It was the media. Thatâ€™s what I think. 

Main point:

### **We will never know why Trump won the 2016 election.**

Why keep talking?

2.

Stephen Colbert. John Stewart. Samantha Bee. Seth Meyers. Bill Maher. John Oliver. 

They mock.
