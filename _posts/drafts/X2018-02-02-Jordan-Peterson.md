People usually don't have time to research all the issues they care about to develop a well-informed opinion. We trust people like journalists or friends to communicate their opinon to us in the hopes that they are more informed than ours.

This is all well and good.

The problem arises when we start treating the majority of people on the Internet like a trusted friend. 

A majority of people believing something does not make it true.

Of course, there is a philosophical aspect to this. In some subjective contexts the majority decides what is true or not. Most often though, there is enough research and information out there to make a decision based on facts.

## Background

This all came up when I discovered the controversy around Jordan Peterson. 

Peterson is a clinical psychologist and a professor at the University of Toronto. 

Sidenote: I am not attempting to defend or justify every controversial stance Peterson has ever taken. This blog post is limited to the subject I am about to bring up.

Jordan Peterson says that there are biological and psychological differences between men and women. 

Even just saying that sounds weird. 

I think it sounds weird because you, the reader, infered that this claim was equivalent to saying:

Jordan Peterson says that women are biologically and psychologically inferior to men.

THIS IS A DIFFERENT CLAIM.

Stating that two thing are different does not mean that any one of them is superior to the other.
