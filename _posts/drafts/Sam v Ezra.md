At its core, Sam Harris and Ezra Klein were talking about two different things.

Sam argues this data has the right to exist. Whether or not the data is *acted upon* in the *real world* is a separate conversation.

Ezra was having that conversation. Ezra argued the real world implications of this data are bad. Therefore, the data is bad.


Sam sees Ezra’s attitude towards the data as detrimental to society in a huge way. (rejection of facts because of political reasons)

Ezra sees Sam’s attitude towards the data as detrimental to society in a huge way.
(justification for racism)

What comes first?

I am inclined to say that facts come first. 
How we react to those facts is a different conversation.

Sheltering society from data like this gives humans less credit than they deserve.

Will a normal person become racist after seeing this data?
No. If they do, there are deeper problems at play.

Ultimately, the genetic makeup of your neighbour shouldn’t sway your opinion of them. 

# The key point here is that researching data and *acting* upon that researched data are two separate things.

Sam is arguing that Murray’s data should be considered scientifically before its considered politically. 

Sam is arguing that if someone does empirical research that proves a conclusion, no matter that person’s motives, beliefs or background, the data should have the right to exist.

Ezra is arguing that since that proven conclusion is bad, that person should not be given any attention. 

Ezra would rather have facts come from someone with better motives, beliefs and background. 

Ezra wants to ignore this data because the messenger who is delivering it may use it for bad reasons.

Sam is arguing that the only value he cares about in the messenger is the research they are delivering. 

Sam wants research, regardless of the conclusion it reaches, to be non-disputable. Facts are facts.

However, the real-world policy implication of those facts can be discussed at length, and he is open to that.

Ezra is confusing the exposure of information with the policy impacts of that information. 

Ezra does not like what this data implies for social policy, therefore, he doesn’t like the data.

Ezra is attempting to suppress and reduce the messenger’s data to suppress and reduce the social policy implications of their data.
