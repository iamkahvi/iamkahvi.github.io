For this assignment students are to engage with different theories of International Relations (IR) (a sub-field in the study of Political Science) and assess the explanatory power of each theory in relation to the film “The Fog of War” (Morris 2003, excerpts shown in the lecture of Tuesday November 7.). In this short paper, students will briefly describe how something shown/described in the documentary relates to one or more of the International Relations (IR) theories studied in class. 

The purpose of this assignment is to have students engage with linking theory and practice. 

Students will practice integrating their understandings of theoretical frameworks and applying them real-life situations. Students will also practice assessing the strengths and weaknesses of different theoretical frameworks in comparison to each other.

Which IR theoretical framework best explains the narrative of any excerpt of the film?

Accurately explain the theoretical framework, 
Succinctly describe the portion(s) of the film they are referring to, 
Offer convincing justification of why the particular theory in question offers the most explanatory power. 

Students should reference only the film and assigned course readings in this short paper.

We can relate theory to practice by drawing parallels between the International Relations theory of Liberalism and McNamara’s own decisions and inclinations as Secretary of State. Additionally, we can relate General Curtis Lemay’s own viewpoints to a Realist perspective. 

Evidence suggesting McNamara’s Liberalist ideology presents itself even before the the Cuban Missile Crisis or the Cold War. At Ford Motors, McNamara focuses on more than simply overtaking the competition. Instead of an adversarial mindset, McNamara focuses on improving the company in response to consumers and not competitors. In this way, McNamara held a Liberalist viewpoint which dictates a passive stance towards conflict and prioritizes other options. 

Our focus will be on the Cuban Missile crisis or the first Lesson in the film. 

## How a more Realist perspective was dangerous in the Cuban Missile Crisis and how a Liberalist mentality lowered the chance of a nuclear war. 

## How a Realist perspective on International Relations was ill-suited for dealing with the Cuban Missile Crisis.

More specifically, how Curtis Lemay represented a Realist mentality and how McNamara and the former US ambassador to Russia Tommy Thompson represented a more Liberalist view.

“What is it we need to do?”

“Mr President we need to do two things it seems to me. We need to develop a specific strike plan. The second thing we have to do is consider the consequences. I don’t know quite what kind of a world we’ll live in after we’ve struck Cuba. How do we stop at the point?”
McNamara’s response demonstrates his Liberalist viewpoint. Although developing a “strike plan” is a priority, he emphasizes the consequences of those actions, inferring that the aforementioned strike plan is not the only option. He voices his ignorance as to what the result of his conflict might be.
McNamara empathizes that “Kennedy was trying to keep us out of war and I was trying to help him keep us out of war”. Liberalism lines up perfectly with this statement. Although Kennedy and McNamara we prepared for war, they did not want it and assumed there were other options.
General Curtis Lemay help an opposing viewpoint. A Realist one. Lemay was adamant that conflict was the only logical option.
When Tommy Thompson urged the President to respond to the soft message, Kennedy voiced his concerns that “we are not going to get these weapons out of Cuba by negotiation anyway”. In this instance Pres Kennedy demonstrates a realist worldview in the sense that he eliminates options to prevent conflict without even trying.
Thompson was right so empathy, fuelled by Liberalism, worked.
At the end of this crisis, in response to Kennedy stating they had won, LeMay disagreed: “Won hell! We lost! We should go in and wipe them out today!”
As McNamara states “Lemay believed that ultimately we’re going to confront these people [Soviet Union] in a conflict with nuclear weapons and we better do ti when we a greater superiority than we will have in the future”.
