This idea was first introduced to me in Jaron Lanier’s book “The Dawn of the New Everything”. It’s a book about Virtual Reality.

Jarons explains that there were two fundamental motivations  that led to the creation of the Internet.

The first saw it as something wholly democratic. In fact, it was _socialist_. All resources should be publicly available and free.

The other motivation was entrepreneurship.  

“How to you celebrate entrepreneurship if everything is free?”

The advertising business model.

As Jaron says, the business model of a company is what motivates decisions.
