description: Overview of Implemented Features

Over the course of summer 2018, I forked and developed a volunteer scheduling database application. The [README ](https://github.com/iamkahvi/volunteers) I created builds on the [forked repositories README](https://github.com/playasoft/volunteers) and describes usage, features and installation of the application.

This post exists to specify which features I developed alone.

## UI Design

### Event Page

I added a legend to the Event page. I changed the text formatting to make the page more legible.
I changed the date format to make the page more legible.

{% include event.html %}

### Dashboard

Using bootstrap list items element, I made the dashboard more legible.

{% include dashboard.html %}

## Backend Features

### Email Notifications

On the advice of the original developer, my plan for developing this feature was:

1. Create a console command which loops through the "slots" table for any slots starting within the next "hour"
2. If a volunteer has signed up for that slot, send them a notification
3. Add value to SQL table to prevent further notifications
4. Add the command to the Laravel cron so it runs periodically (every 5 minutes? 15 minutes?)

This approach was somewhat efficient given the Laravel cron would be running continuously when it wouldn't need to. Scheduling a task immediately when a user signs up instead of iterating through the table would be a better approach. Ultimately I chose to implement the feature as a simple solution using the existing schema as opposed to changing the schema and the controller logic.

To work through the logic of when to send reminders, I create variables for when the shift starts and when to remind the user for that specific
shift. I do this by creating two Carbon dates and add a designated amount of hours to the second variable.

```php
<?php

// Cycle through all the slots
foreach($shifts as $shift)
{
	$startDate = new Carbon(date('Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime("$shift->start_date $shift->start_time")));

	$remindDate = new Carbon(date('Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime("$shift->start_date $shift->start_time")));

	$now = Carbon::now();

	$remindDate->subHours(env('REMIND_HOURS'));

```
Then I notify the user of the shift.

```php
<?php			
// Notify user of upcoming shift
if($shift->isNotified == 'No')
{
	$user->notify(new shiftStarting($shift, $user));
} else
```

In order to prevent the user from getting continuously notified, I created a column in the shifts table to track notification status.

```php
<?php

// Update isNotifies value in SQL database
DB::table('slots')
	->where('id', $shift->id)
	->update(['isNotified' => 'Yes']);

```


### Hide Empty Days Feature

My strategy was to cycle through each day that would be displayed on the event page and check if the day had a shift.
Fortunately, this check was relatively simple after looking into different SQL queries.

```php
<?php
// Pluck all of the shift IDs for this event and check the if any in the schedule start today
if(Schedule::whereIn('shift_id', $shifts)->where('dates', 'LIKE', "%".$date->format('Y-m-d')."%")->get()->isEmpty())
{
// Continue onto the next day
$date->addDay();
continue;
```
### Filter by week

Fortunately, I've had previous experience with Javascript in University so working out the logic for this feature was trivial.

```javascript
// Hide all the days
$('.days .day').addClass('hidden');

// Convert date to Moment format
let m = moment();

m = moment(date.toString());

// Show this one

// Loop through seven days
for(var i = 0; i < 7; i++)
{
    $('.days .day[data-date="' + m.format('Y-MM-DD') + '"]').removeClass('hidden');
    $(window).trigger('resize');
    m.add(1, 'days');
}
```
The most challenging part of implementing this feature was working out how to install the Moment package on the active server. Without this package, I wasn't able to manipulate date strings easily.
Since the server ran Ubuntu, the package wouldn't install. After a few hours of Googling, one line of code in the header.blade.php
solved all my problems.

```html
 <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/moment@2.22.2/moment.min.js"></script>
```
