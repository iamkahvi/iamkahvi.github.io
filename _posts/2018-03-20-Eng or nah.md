Eng or nah???

I had a jarring revelation today. For the entirety of my four years at this university, I will not be able to take any electives.
I’ll be around the same people for four years of my life.

After crafting a pretty engaging speech about the advantages of cross-pollination, that future seems pretty depressing. 
Is that an inevitability of university?
Do you take more courses with the same people no matter what program you’re in?

I want the most of wherever I am.

I know my life will not go according to plan, but if I have the options the makes choices about my future now, shouldn’t I?

There’s this weird belief in University that is held by almost everyone I’ve met here that boils down to one thing: Your career is directly proportional to your degree.
^ That idea isn’t a lie. I’m sure if we talk about the majority of people, this rule applies.
Am I the majority though?

Pros: 
I have an amazing opportunity to make sure I will never have to worry about work again. I’ll have a professional degree that sets me apart from every other undergraduate.

Cons:
I’ll be using 4/5 prime years of my life to do something I may not enjoy.

There’s a scale in my mind: 
The more enjoyable my University experience gets, the less practical it becomes.
I’m starting to believe that it’s an inverse relationship that is absolute.
