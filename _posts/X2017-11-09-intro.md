I’ve come to realize that I am not educated enough about most subjects for anyone to take my opinion seriously. 

All I can offer is my perspective.

This blog is not to educate or to persuade. Only to share.

If the *facts* presented in any of these post are inaccurate, please send me an email.

To be clear: On issues other than how to graduate from high school and hair care, my opinions shouldn’t be taken that seriously.
